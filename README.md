## Run Test
### Setting to run with browser
- Navigate to project directory and open `wdio.cfg.js` and search for `capabilities`. I already setting up for chrome, firefox and msedge
- If you want to run on which browser just uncomment that browser setting, and comment the other one
- If you want to run on multiple browser just uncomment other browser setting. It would run on both browsers in your config file

### Running command
- Navigate to project directory
- Run command:
```bash
npx wdio
```
- Or you can run by helper file
- Run with xvfb in headless mode
```bash
chmod a+x run_headless.sh
./run_headless.sh
```
- Normal run and see report after running complete
```bash
chmod a+x run_helper.sh
./run_helper.sh
```

- Sample result:
```bash
